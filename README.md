This repo is partially abandoned, in its current form this project is just a
proof of concept.

The project uses basic blocks like strings, numbers, images, etc. to create
“database tables”. The same blocks (although functionally different) can be used
to create reusable elements, for example an entry preview and the full entry,
the appearance of these elements can also be edited.

The project also provides more advanced blocks like carousels, paginators, etc.
With the provided blocks and the created elements it is possible to create full
websites without any knowledge of programming or need to install a theme.
